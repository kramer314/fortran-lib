Description
===========
This is a collection of Fortran modules and routines I have written for use in
other (primarily numerical / scientific) codes. I've compiled them here to have
a sort of "standard library" to link other codes against.

Dependencies
============
* Fortran compiler; some Fortran 2003/2008 support required.
  Currently tested on gfortran 5.2.
* SCons
  Currently tested on SCons 2.4
